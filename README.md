## Project Objective:

This project is aimed at generating insights on gym members' workout habits and performance metrics, with the goal of
creating actionable recommendations for improving fitness, health, and workout performance, which was visualized in the first page. And also to help gym managers understand the behavioral pattern and trends of their gym members for improved customer satisfaction. The later was visualized in the second page canvas.
## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://github.com/ahanspaschal/PowerBi-Gym-Dataset-Project/blob/main/gym_members_exercise_tracking_synthetic_data.csv">Link To Dataset</a>
## Questions(KPIs)

## First Page(Facility users Dashboard)
- What is the most effective workout type in terms of calorie burnt?
- Relationship between volume of water intake and calories burnt
- Which is the most frequent work out type?
- How long is spent in a workout session on average? 
- Relationship between frequency of workout and average body fat percentage.
- Workout type preference by gender and BMI group.

## Second Page(Managers Dashboard)
- Distribution of members age group
- Gender distribution of gym members
- Members distribution based on their experience level
- Work out type preference by age group
- Total frequency of each workout type for the given period of time

- Dashoard Interaction <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/c/2ffbe0b0e58b637b/Ecf-vH81wdVEif4GWzq8J-IBHIq4tSYVN5ddqvOsw3lqiQ?e=BgPkOR">View Dasboard</a>

## Steps Taken
- Performed extraction, loading and transforming(ETL) process on the dataset.
- On transforming with Powerbi powerquery, I corrected some inconsistencies and errors in the dataset which can affect my visualization. I removed filtered empty rows. Some numerical column appeared as text column, I 
  changed the data type to numerical and some to float accordingly. 
- Still on transformation, I utilized the powerbi DAX to create extra columns from existing columns. For instance, the Age_group column was created from the age column, experience_class column was created from 
  already existing experience_level column etc.
- After transformation, the data was loaded into powerbi and was used to create an interactive and insightful dashboard.

## Project insight:

- The dashboard showed that yoga is most effective in burning calorie, and it also showed that members spend the highest amount of time(1.44 hours) on average during yoga session. 
- The dashboard showed a posistive relationship between water intake and calorie
- It can be seen from the dashboard that strength work out type is the most frequent workout type. I:e members spent more weeks on stregth work out type
- The dashboard shows that the more the frequency of workout, the lower the average body fat percentage
- It can also be seen that more Men prefer strength workout type, and more women prefer yoga.
- The data shows that very larger percentage of the gym members are between the older adults (29 - 49 years).
- Data showed that most gym members are underweight(below 18.5 BMI)
- From the dashboard, it can be seen that about 42% of the gym members have intermediate experience, 38% are beginners and the remaining 20% are advanced.
- It can be seen that teenagers and young adults prefer the strength workout type the most, older adults prefer cardio and the elderly prefer yoga the most.


## Project Summary:

The dashboard revealed key patterns and relationships that can help the gym optimize its offerings and tailor programs to member needs. Here’s a summary of the findings:

### Workout Preferences and Effectiveness

- Yoga emerged as the most effective workout for burning calories, with members spending the longest average session duration (1.44 hours) on yoga.
- Strength Training was the most frequent workout type, indicating its popularity among members.


### Gender Preferences

- Women preferred yoga.

### Age Group Preferences
- Teenagers and Young Adults favored strength training.
- Older Adults (29–49 years) preferred cardio.
- The Elderly preferred yoga.

### Health and Fitness Trends
- A positive relationship was observed between water intake and calories burned, suggesting that hydration plays a role in workout performance.
- Members with a higher workout frequency had a lower average body fat percentage, highlighting the importance of consistent exercise for fat loss.
- A significant portion of gym members were underweight (BMI below 18.5), indicating a potential need for nutritional guidance or weight-gain programs.


### Demographic Insights
- The majority of gym members were older adults (29–49 years), making this age group the primary target audience.
